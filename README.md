##Idea:

The idea of Facesmash (previouly Socialnetwk.com) is a website & app to display any content a user makes, or any content they share. It is a social media based website without any Advertisements or false media unlike Facebook. The idea is to create a purely media and creator based website, without the distraction of false media and add filled content.
Without the need to open up various other websites that offer one function only, such as youtube - a video creation and sharing platform. - Facebook a social chatty media website which is falling down like bricks. The idea is to keep everything in the same place. Without having to go to other websites that offer different services, I first came up with the idea because I had to keep opening up various other tabs as a way of sharing different media dependant on what it is. This can easily eat through your internet speed and traffic. There's no need for multiple websites. Why can't we have it in one place? That's exactly why I came up with the idea. Social media platforms these days such as Facebook, are so full of “In your face” content, which is also dependant on how you feel… Facebook collects a Huge amount of data based on the user, what they watch, what they click on etc. And this is used to build up a “virtual timeline” of the user, which can then predict how said user is feeling next thursday. This then means Facebook can show you certain content on Thursday because it knows your going to feel low or depressed as it Knows you spend a lot of money when you feel this way. Therefore Facebook's AI shows you content that YOU the user will buy. And will keep feeding you this media to keep you in that current state so they can profit More and More from you. --- This, this is exactly why the idea of Facesmash came together. Because it is a Pure media and creator based website, which does not ALLOW Advertisement, false media, or media shown to you dependant on how you feel…. People want a website they can go to for true media which isn’t lied about, or fed to you. They want to find and share what They want.

##Functionality




##How we will profit - Make money
We will allow users to Unlock certian features of the website - view these as Prime parts of the site. Such as allowing them upload different file formats to maintain quality in images (Allow a user to upload in RAW)
Or allow a user to have a custom username or URL - A quick way for someone to find them or contact them. These include https://www.facesmash.com/cassie (A users profile/page/ etc)

The way we profit from the site will be allowing users to do what is mentioned above and also allow them to maybe possibly add a rank to their profile page. Such as user is ranked over 100, therefore viewed as trusted. Or allow a user to buy views - Not likes! Just views, that way the viewer can decide to like it or not. 

Or even have a “platinum” area in the discover section for creators to pay to have their content showed in the highly rated area
